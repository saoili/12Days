12Days
======

High level spec for this app / program is that it will produce the winners for 
the 'twelve days of Christmas' raffle. This raffle will have twelve days of 
prizes, twelve winners on the first day, eleven on the second, and so on. The 
winners will be chosen from a list of names (this will probably initially be
an excel spreadsheet) and no one should win more than one prize.

First Prototype - November 19th 2013
Simple program that expects a comma seperated list of names in a file called 
'names.csv' in the same folder as the python file. This program asks the user
how many names to produce. This prototype can serve the function if necessary,
but the .csv file will need to be created in advance and edited to remove 
winners each day.
